# ECE366Group11

- Place information revalent to delieverables and running code here.
- Our ISA design is called CTZ (Cam Teja Zach) it had the best ring to it.

## ISA Instruction Information

## ECE366_mod17_7inst.asm

Believed to be working version for any P and Q but DIC is very high.

## Python program `assembler.py`

Execute: `python assembler.py`

- This python script will assemble instructions of the CTZ ISA design into binary machine code. 
- The program adds even parity bit encodeing as the first bit in each instructon.
- Defaultly uses CTZ_instructions.txt as input and CTZ_machine_code.txt as output when run.
